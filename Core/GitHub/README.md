# GitHub Issue Service

The `GitHubIssueService` provides functionality to programmatically create GitHub issues using the GitHub REST API.

## Features

- Creates GitHub issues via REST API using stored authentication token
- Proper error handling and logging
- Returns issue number for verification
- Includes both generic and test-specific methods

## Requirements

- GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) configured in `ApplicationSettings.GithubToken`
- Target repository: `warboundio/warbound`

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```csharp
using Core.GitHub;

GitHubIssueService service = new();

// Create an issue with custom title and body
int issueNumber = await service.Create("My Issue Title", "Issue description goes here");
Console.WriteLine($"Created issue #{issueNumber}");
```

### Test Issue Creation

```csharp
using Core.GitHub;

GitHubIssueService service = new();

// Create a test issue with hardcoded values
int issueNumber = await service.CreateTestIssue();
// This creates an issue with:
// Title: "Test Issue from Agent"
// Body: "This is a test issue body generated by the agent."
```

## Configuration

The service automatically reads the GitHub token from `ApplicationSettings.Instance.GithubToken`. 

Ensure your GitHub token has the following permissions:
- `repo` scope (for creating issues in private repositories)
- `public_repo` scope (for creating issues in public repositories)

## Headers and Authentication

The service automatically includes the required headers:
- `Authorization: Bearer <GH_TOKEN>`
- `Accept: application/vnd.github+json`
- `User-Agent: WarboundETL`

## Logging

The service uses the Warbound logging infrastructure (`Core.Logs.Logging`) to log:
- Successful issue creation (with URL and issue number)
- Any errors that occur during the process

## API Endpoint

Issues are created via POST request to:
```
https://api.github.com/repos/warboundio/warbound/issues
```

## Return Value

Both methods return an `int` representing the GitHub issue number that was created. This can be used to construct the full URL: `https://github.com/warboundio/warbound/issues/{issueNumber}`
