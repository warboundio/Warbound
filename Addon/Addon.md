# Warbound Addon

## Overview

The Warbound addon project is designed to provide a C# utility for managing and publishing World of Warcraft addon files. This project enables the publishing of Lua addon code from a development subfolder directly into the World of Warcraft addons directory for testing and deployment.

---

## Current Implementation

The addon project currently contains:
- Basic C# project structure (.csproj file)
- Project documentation and draft files

---

## Core Functionality

### Publishing System

The primary function of this project is to facilitate the development workflow for World of Warcraft addons by providing automated publishing capabilities that move Lua addon files from the development environment into the appropriate World of Warcraft addon directory.

## Philosophy

- **Development Workflow Focus** – Streamlines the process of testing and deploying addon code during development.
- **Automation First** – Reduces manual file management overhead when working with WoW addon development.
- **Utility Tool** – Serves as a supporting tool in the broader Warbound development ecosystem.
