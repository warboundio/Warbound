# Admin Panel Drafts

## Draft: Cleanup
### Agent
We've built a lot really quickly and it's time to take a look at all of our files. Things like Counter and Weather should be removed both in files and from the navigation. WorkflowThreadView should be in the Admin section of pages. We shouldn't default to the home page. We should default to Pages/Admin/Duca. Looking at Duca there's some css in there that should be in a CSS file not in line on the page.
