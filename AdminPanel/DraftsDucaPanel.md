# DUCA Admin Panel Drafts

## Draft: Implement Draft Stubs
### Agent
Ideally every draft should be a 'stub' in the UI that can be selected. The developer will then add in the body additional details and requirements. Following that, a GitHub issue will be created to create a Plan for the draft with the supplemental information.
