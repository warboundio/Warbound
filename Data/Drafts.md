# Data Drafts

## Draft: Add Quest Object
## Agent
So this won't exactly follow the plan like the other endpoints and ETLs have. Here we have three different ways to source out a 'quest'. The QuestArea, the QuestCategories, and QuestType. When we call something like QuestAreaEndpoint we're going to see all quests for that particular grouping. The same goes for the QuestCategories and QuestType. So we created a 'QuestIdentifier' enum to identify which of these the quest came from. QuestAreaIndex, QuestCategoriesIndex, and QuestTypeIndex all follow the same pattern, so let's just talk to QuestAreaIndex and follow it for all three. QuestAreaIndexETL will put an id and the name for each of the areas in the game. So our quest object needs to know the 'QuestIdentifier' (in this case the QuestArea) and the id that was assigned to it from the QuestAreaIndexETL. So our Quest object will have the following fields: Id, Name (511 max length), QuestIdentifier (QuestIdentifier enum), QuestIdentifierId (the id from the QuestAreaIndexETL, QuestCategoriesIndexETL, or QuestTypeIndexETL). The status will be set to NEEDS_ENRICHMENT_ and the UTC time will be set to the current time. Once we have that object complete and ready, we will populate it via the varying QuestIdentifiers.
