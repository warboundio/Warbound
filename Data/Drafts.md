# Data Drafts

## Draft: Models Folder
## Agent
Right now we have a lot of 'Models' in the endpoints folder in the Data project. Can we move these to a Models folder inside the Data project? This will help keep things organized and make it easier to find the models we need. Specifically we want any enums to go to the enum folder and any of the models that are a part of the blizzartapicontext to go to the Models folder. Anything in the Endpoints folder is in scope. Don't move other files. Ensure all tests pass afterwards.
