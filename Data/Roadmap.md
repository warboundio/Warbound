# Data Drafts

## Draft: Implement Encounter Journal Data
### Agent
Journal API. Encounter Journal data can provide definitive loot sources for a lot of different items. We need to pay special attention to which difficulty and sized instances are required.

## Draft: Review the Quest API
### Developer
I'm not sure what all is in there but if we have rewards from quests this would be a huge source of information. Regardless it may add a lot of context as to how to complete a particular quest or where it is in a sequence. 

## Draft: Review the Reputation API
### Developer
I'm not sure what all is in there but if we have rewards from reputation this would be a huge source of information. Regardless it may add a lot of context as to how to complete a particular reputation when it leads to a collection item.

## Draft: Review the Creature API
### Developer
I'm 99% certain there is no collection data in the creature API but it may provide some context for how to find a creature or where it is located.

## Draft: Review the Achievement API
### Developer
I'm not sure what all is in there but if we have rewards from achievements this would be a huge source of information. Regardless it may add a lot of context as to how to complete a particular achievement when it leads to a collection item.
