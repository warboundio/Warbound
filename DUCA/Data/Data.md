# Warbound Data Infrastructure

## Purpose

The Data project serves as the **foundational layer** for Warbound.io, responsible for collecting, processing, and enriching all collectible item data from World of Warcraft. This system bridges the gap between Blizzard's raw API data and the rich, contextual information that powers Warbound's collection tracking, guides, and goal systems.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. 🔄 Data Collection & ETL

Automated extraction, transformation, and loading of collectible data:
- Transmog appearances and sources  
- Mounts, pets, toys, and recipes
- Item metadata, media, and relationships
- Profession and crafting information
- Realm and server data

### 2. 🎯 Data Enrichment

Layering contextual information on top of Blizzard's base data:
- Source attribution (where items come from)
- Obtain methods and requirements
- Geographic context (zones, NPCs, coordinates)
- Difficulty and accessibility ratings
- Historical and seasonal availability

### 3. 🗄️ Schema Management

Maintaining the structured data foundation:
- Entity relationships and constraints
- Data validation and integrity checks
- Migration handling and versioning
- Performance optimization for large datasets

## Philosophy

- **Reliability First** – Data collection runs continuously and handles API inconsistencies gracefully.
- **Enrichment Over Volume** – Focus on meaningful, actionable data rather than exhaustive coverage.
- **Extensible by Design** – New collectible categories and data points can be added without architectural changes.
- **Source of Truth** – This system defines the canonical state of all Warbound collectible data.

The Data project doesn't just move information—it transforms it into the foundation that makes Warbound's collection guidance possible.
