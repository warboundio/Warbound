### Plans & Context

**Plans** live in `Project/Plans/` and describe work units. Focus on intent, edge cases, and deviations from norms. Context lives in `*.Agent.md` files next to source code.

**Writing Plans:**
* State why, not how
* Link relevant `*.Agent.md` files  
* Define scope and boundaries
* Highlight edge cases and testing needs
* Do not blow up the scope of the original draft or plan - we'll have additional agents to improve the code later

### Drafts

**Drafts** are work stubs for single PRs. Format:
```
## Draft: <Title>
### <Agent> or <Developer>
Brief scope description with clear boundaries.
```
---

## ðŸ¤– For Agents

### Execution Rules

1. **Follow the Plan's intent.** You own implementation details.
2. **Read referenced `*.Agent.md` files** before editing code.
3. **Update context files** if behaviors change.
4. **Write strong unit tests** unless Plan specifies otherwise.

### Code Constraints

**Refactoring:**
- **No backward compatibility aliases**: When refactoring classes, do a straight refactor. Do not create alias classes for backward compatibility.
- **Complete reference updates**: Update all references to the old class name throughout the codebase.

**Database:**
- **No automatic Entity Framework migrations**: Do not create migration files. Developers handle database changes manually.
- **Entity definition only**: Define entities in code but let developers manage the actual database schema changes.

### Success Criteria

* Modify only scoped files
* Follow all referenced context rules
* Update `*.Agent.md` files when needed
* Code compiles, tests pass
* Remove completed drafts from `/Project/Drafts.md`
* Update `/Project/Project.md` to reflect current state of the code (do not update to denote that a plan was made, only update when the code is complete and the plan is done))

## ðŸ§­ Philosophy

DUCA provides agents stable, local context to write code safely in large systems. When agents succeed, it's because the Plan was complete and context was discoverable.

If the PR doesn't fit â€” fix the Plan or context, not the agent.
